# Homeworks

- Due at midnight
  - Two **free** late days with no deductions
  - After this, 20% deducted for each day late
  - Additional late days for extenuating circumstances _only_ (but I am lenient)
    - Holidays and classwork are _not_ extenuating
- Grade breakdown (out of 25):
  - 15 points for correctness (autograded/ manually graded)
  - 5 points for best practices (manually graded)
  - 5 points for code style (manually graded)

Style grades are **addititive**, not **subtractive**; an incomplete assignment is worth zero points.

## ESLint

- Style checking tool used to determine the 'best practices' portion of your homework grade
- Instructions for running ESLint on your own code are included with HW1
- Worth 5 points per homework
  - There's no excuse for missing these points since you can run it locally! -->

# Academic Integrity

- Don't copy/paste code from online sources
- Don't have "mid-level" discussions
  - High-level: What's this homework about?
  - Low-level: What is the syntax for XYZ in JavaScript?
  - Mid-level (**bad**): How did you do the XML parser for HW2?
- It's _really easy_ to detect plagiarism - just don't copy code

# Grading

- 60% Homework
- 40% Final Project

- This is a half-credit class, and I want it to be actually a half-credit class! So please email me if you want more time or anything.
